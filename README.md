Checklist| file / tab | item| sign | file / tab | item | Notes
-|-|-|-|-|-|-
C.5, X.9 | Funds Receipt | DDRS by bs | = | Funds Receipt | Adjusted GAFS by bs | if they do not match, a tic mark should explain the variance.  If the variance isn't properly explained, email Stacy
x.6 | Funds Receipt | Unadjusted_GAFS-R_Total (Total) | = | Approp Real Register Number | GAFS (Real)
C.7 | Funds Receipt | AFM_Total (Total) | = | Approp Real Register Number | GAFS_AFM | compare to register tab sub totals
X.7 | X by GLAC | GAFS Total by basic symbol | = |  Approp Real Register Number | GAFS totals by bs | compare subtotals by bs against subtotals by bs in Register Number tabs
X.8.a | X by GLAC | AFM sum total | = | Funds Receipt | AFM sum total | by dept (if multiple exist: ie. 57, 69)
X.8.b | X by GLAC | GAFS sum total | = | Funds Receipt | GAFS sum total |

## ⭐⭐Discrepancies⭐⭐

+  means variance was identified in footnotes

Section | bs |  Found in JVs | Notes
-|-|-|-|
D.6 | 3400+ <br> 3010+ <br>3080+ |  ❌<br> ✔️   <br> ✔️| May have something to do with the copy/paste mismatch near row 211 ⭐ | GAFS ( funds Receipts) Vs GAFS (Real)
D.7 | 0740+ <br> 0745+<br>3010+ <br>3080+<br>3300+<br>3400+ <br>3600+ |✔️<br>✔️<br>✔️<br>✔️<br>✔️<br> ❌<br> ❌|**GAFS by bs (GLAC) Vs GAFS by bs (REAL)**<br><br>All checked off were values found in JV log, though there were equal numbers of debits and credits, so I'm not sure if the excess could actually be validated here<br><br> 3400, 3600 had some amount copy/paste mismatch around row 211
D.8, E.8 | ❌  | ❌ |GAFS (GLAC) VS. GAFS (Funds Receipts)<br><br>Discrepancies are similar to Q3. <br> - Transfers match exactly when using **_Adjusted_GAFSR_Totals_** <br> - Rescissions match exactly when using **_UnAdjusted_GAFSR_Totals_**
