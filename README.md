x.5 | Funds Receipt | DDRS by bs | = | Funds Receipt | Adjusted GAFS by bs | if they do not match, a tic mark should explain the variance.  If the variance isn't properly explained, email Stacy
x.6 | Funds Receipt | Unadjusted_GAFS-R_Total (Total) | = | Approp Real Register Number | GAFS (Real)
D.7, E.7 | X by GLAC | GAFS Total by basic symbol | = |  Approp Real Register Number | GAFS totals by bs | compare subtotals by bs against subtotals by bs in Register Number tabs
D.8, E.8 | X by GLAC | AFM, GAFS sum totals | = | Funds Receipt | AFM, GAFS sum total | by dept (if multiple exist: ie. 57, 69)
D.9, E.9 | X by GLAC | AFM, GAFS sum totals | = | Funds Receipt | AFM, GAFS sum totals | match totals between Funds Receipts and X by GLAC

## ⭐⭐Discrepancies⭐⭐

+  means variance was identified in footnotes

Section | bs |  Found in JVs | Notes
-|-|-|-|
D.6 | 3400 <br> 3010 <br>3080 |  <br>    <br> | May have something to do with the copy/paste mismatch near row 211 ⭐ | GAFS ( funds Receipts) Vs GAFS (Real)
D.7 | 0740 <br> 0745<br>3010 <br>3080<br>3300<br>3400 <br>3600 |<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>  <br>  |**GAFS by bs (GLAC) Vs GAFS by bs (REAL)**<br><br>All checked off were values found in JV log, though there were equal numbers of debits and credits, so I'm not sure if the excess could actually be validated here<br><br> 3400, 3600 had some amount copy/paste mismatch around row 211
D.8, E.8 |    |   |GAFS (GLAC) VS. GAFS (Funds Receipts)<br><br>Discrepancies are similar to Q3. <br> - Transfers match exactly when using **_Adjusted_GAFSR_Totals_** <br> - Rescissions match exactly when using **_UnAdjusted_GAFSR_Totals_**
